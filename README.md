# Atom-Cavity-Interactions
Code for simulating a three-level atom interaction with the single mode of a high-finesse optical cavity, in the regime of strong coupling to calculate the second-order correlation function of the light that is transmitted through the cavity when individual atoms pass through the cavity mode.
